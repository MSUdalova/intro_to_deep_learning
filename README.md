# Intro_to_deep_learning
Jupyter Notebooks for Intro to Deep Learning course

1. hw1: Implement a linear classifier and train it using stochastic gradient descent modifications.
2. hw2: We have 50000 28x28 images of digits from 0 to 9. We will train a classifier on this data. We will train a linear model and then compare it to the MLP with 2 hidden layers. 
3. hw3: Build first Convolutional Neural Network. Fine-tune InceptionV3 architecture for flowers classification task.
4. hw4: Train own autoencoder for human faces!
5. hw5: Generating names with recurrent neural networks.
6. hw6: Define and train an image-to-caption model, that can produce descriptions for real world images.
